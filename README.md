## Victor's Repositories

This github profile has too many projects, and thought they are public, not all of them are equally interesting. They fall in the following categories.

### The Art of HPC

I have a textbook series The Art of HPC. The public repositories are here. You should find this very interesting.

### Teaching projects

I create repositories for publishing class materials for my UT courses. They are open because why not.

### TACC projects

Support for my work at TACC. These repositories are purely as an easy way to sync between different machines. I doubt that many people are interested in this.
