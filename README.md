## Victor's Repositories

This github page has too many projects. They fall in the following categories.

### The Art of HPC

I have a textbook series The Art of HPC. The public repositories are here.

### Teaching projects

I create repositories for publishing class materials for my UT courses. They are open because why not.

### TACC projects

Support for my work at TACC. These repositories are purely as an easy way to sync between different machines.
